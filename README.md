**June 13, 2016 - I dont have any time to work on this recently. If people want to contribute lets get a good working version over here [westonganger/cordova-plugin-camera-preview](https://github.com/westonganger/cordova-plugin-camera-preview/tree/skanygin) with some additional features and nicer API that would be great. Then we can get it merged back to master on this repo.**

**May 18, 2016 - Current development to get a decent stable updated version is happening on the fork [westonganger/cordova-plugin-camera-preview](https://github.com/westonganger/cordova-plugin-camera-preview/tree/skanygin). This will be merged into master here once its working. Please direct all pull requests over there until further notice.**
